    <h2>Overview</h2>

    <p>
        This site is meant to be a convenient location to view and download the historical and current
        statistical data that has been reported by
        <em>The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints</em> on its Facts and Statistics pages.
    </p>

    <p>
        This page is privately developed and maintained and is not affiliated with the LDS church.
        The data is provided as-is with no guarantee of its accuracy. Sources and the means to verify them are described in the Methodology section below.
    </p>

        In the spirit of transparency and open data principles, this dataset may be used for any purpose and is released under the <a href="https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Creative Commons CC0 1.0 Universal (Public Domain Dedication)</a>.

    <h2>Methodology</h2>

    <p>
        Since 2012, the LDS Church has reported global and regional metrics for membership and
        organizational data. Snapshots of these pages are periodically archived by the Wayback
        Machine.
    </p>

    <p>
        To create the dataset for this dashboard, at least one snapshot per month was sought.
        If a monthly snapshot was not available, the next available snapshot was used.
    </p>
    <p>
        Links to all of the Wayback Machine snapshots used for the <em>historical</em> data (pre- December 2025) on this page can be found in <a target='_blank' href='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LatterDataSaint/LDS-Statistics-Dashboard/refs/heads/main/data/historical_fs_sources.csv'>this csv file</a>. 
    </p>
    <p>
        A csv identifying the links for all of the <em>current</em> data can be <a target='_blank' href='https://github.com/LatterDataSaint/LDS-Statistics-Dashboard/blob/main/data/current_fs_sources.csv' >downloaded here</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Verification of the data on this site can be done by visiting the links and reviewing the reported figures.
    </p>

    <h2 id="normalized-series">Using the <em>Normalized</em> Facts and Statistics Pages</h2>

    <p>
        Over time, the Facts and Statistics pages have used different terminology for the same
        underlying statistic. For example, “Family History Centers” was used from 2012 to 2023,
        after which it was changed to “Family Search Centers” from 2023 to 2025, and then returned 
        to "Family History Centers." The normalized dataset combines series whose only apparent difference is the reported name.
    </p>

    <p>
        Unchecking the "Use Normalized Data" box will result in the data series being broken up into its 
        original reported names which will be more historically literal but will also be less useful 
        for visualizing and interpreting the data since it will create gaps in the charts.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        The table below summarizes how the normalized series were created by combining the corresponding raw data series. 
        If no normalization was needed, the table shows "n/a" for the raw series name.
    </p>

    <h2>*Notes on Operating Temples</h2>

    <p>
        When publishing temple data, the Facts and Statistics pages have reported numbers that are a mix of operating temples and 
        announced temples without distinguishing between the two which makes it impossible to combine them into a single normalized 
        dataset. For this reason, the <strong>Operating Temples</strong> as reported in this dashboard does not come directly from 
        the Facts and Statistics pages but instead comes from the <a target='_blank' href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_temples_(LDS_Church)'>Wikipedia temple timeline</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Although the Facts and Statistics pages have started reporting "Operating Temples" again, the wikipedia timeline will continue to 
        be used by this dashboard indefinitely.
